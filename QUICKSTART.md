## ðŸ§ª Testing the System

### Create a Test Order (Using Backend API)

You can create a test order using this PowerShell command:

```powershell
$body = @{
    tableNumber = 5
    customerPhone = "+1234567890"
    items = @(
        @{
            menuItemId = "GET_FROM_MENU_API"
            name = "Margherita Pizza"
            quantity = 2
            specialInstructions = "Extra cheese"
        }
    )
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/orders" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

Or use the customer app (if you've set it up).

### Watch Real-time Updates

1. Open Admin Panel in one browser window
2. Open Kitchen Panel in another browser window
3. Create an order using the customer app or API
4. Watch as the order appears in both panels instantly!

## ðŸ“± Connect Customer App

To complete the full system:

1. Setup the customer app (in the `customer` folder)
2. Customers scan QR code â†’ Visit menu â†’ Place orders
3. Orders appear in kitchen panel automatically
4. Kitchen staff updates order status
5. Customer receives WhatsApp notifications
